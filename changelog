v0.2:
- shrunk drivecode size
- serial transfer back at 74 cycles / byte
- fixed sporadic data corruption while loading
- to allow more variance in rotation speed of disc

v0.3:
- further shrunk drive- and resident code
- added 40 track support
- removed intermittent stepping for now as it caused some problems
- NTSC support via config (no autodetect yet)
- removed depack offset feature, too bloated

v0.4:
- waste more cycles when uploading code, here it's a good thing :-)
- added load_next functionality
- added all config params to config.inc, also addresses and so on
- added signalling for first block to be transferred, so less painfull and
smaller code
- added ntsc autodetection and modify code in case
- resident part is now copied by installer, no further manual copy action
needed. Calling bitfire_install_ is now sufficient.
- added a basic framework with load/load_next hooks that can be called safely
without being overwritten, including macros for linking
- initial detection code for sid/cia type with globally available flags
- offloaded blockmap handling and barriers to diskdrive (saves a fair amount
of space on the resident part!)
- further drivecode cleanup and thus saving bytes
- track now checked via header checksum, no explicit checks needed anymore
- bitnax allows now to reference preceeding data that is split/cut off with
--cut-load-addr. This makes files smaller, but preceeding data must be loaded
and depacked beforehand. --full-dict is introduced as switch for that.

v0.5:
- overlap is calculated on a new basis and thus lower
- depack can be done completely in place with zero overlap. This is the new
default. Switch back to old behaviour, but tighter margins with --overlap when using bitnax
- d64write spits out blocks free
- fix assert bug (bailed out with false alarm) on files with huge literals
- fix compilation error with resident.asm when NMI_GAPS are used without
framework
- clean up errors and added warnings on lz.c, and added possibility to exit on
warnings (good if build output is too messy to spot the warnings)
- more documentation

v0.6:
- fix broken NTSC ;_; the indexed opcodes changed from ,x to ,y and an extra nop cured
many things
- shrink resident code size, after we have bloated it with in place depacking
- standalone loader size now $7b bytes \o/
- faster init
- get rid of inversion during sending of data (filename/init)
- allow for an even wider rpm variance when reading a sector/header
- fixed packer. With a given --load-addr and zero overlap option, the last
literal was not copied. It is now included into the stream in that case, and
it is taken care that the file ends with a 257 byte match to signal EOF. Also
needed a fix in the depacker that slows it down :-(
- motor spin up time: relying on checksums is not enough there, in very rare
cases we happen to load junk despite all the checksumming. What a bother! Now
loading arbitrary blocks on spin up until there's success.
- shrink drivecode size after those additions
- testsuite now included
- fixed code upload/reset_drive
- even faster init
- fixed decomp under IO issues and issues with loading of remaining literal
blobs > 255 bytes
- improved depacker speed a bit after other fixes slowed it down and bloat
resident size again up to the max by that, dammit! :-D
- fixed different $01 values depending on hw-detection
- added resident_minimal_zp.asm a minimal version residing in zeropage. Could
be squeezed down to $6a bytes. Useful?
- added --relocate-to addr switch to pack files as if loaded with an
alternative load-address (also helps with --binfile)
- give notice if more then 1 drive is on bus to avoid injuries and pebcak
- switch to 2MHz mode where possible on 1571 especially during transfer to
be on the safe side

v0.7
- add also sln and vcproj files for bitnax
- possibility to choose between NMI and raster IRQ for baseirq
- add possibility for buslock to allow arbitrary $dd00 writes when loader is
idle, and add macros for that (bus_lock, bus_unlock $bank)
- fix spin up handling of read dummy sectors (might have been skipped under
some circumstances)
- shrink size
- save few bytes on some relocated packed files
